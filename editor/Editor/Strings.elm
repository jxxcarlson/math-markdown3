External copy-paste
-------------------

- ctrl-shift-u copies text from the system
  clipboard and pastes the content to the
  editor at current cursor.  The copied
  text remains in the Editor clipboard.

- ctrl-shift-v pastes text from Editor
  clipboard

The pasted text will be wrapped if the
the WrapOption is on.

This works in Chrome 79 but not Firefox.
In Chrome you have to respond to a permission
dialog each time.  I'll see if this can
be reduced to once per session.

info =
    """This is a first test of how
the editor could be used as a package.
The 'Info' button is a proxy for loading new
content into the editor from an external
source.

Everything in this window is from `Editor.view`.  All
the rest is in `Main`, though of course it uses
functions exported by `Editor`, e.g., the slider.

The "Reset" button loads the initial text.
The "Gettysburg address" button loads
Abraham Lincoln's speech.  It contains three
very long lines which are wrapped by the editor
before you see them.  I need to devote more
thought to how best to do text wrapping â€”
it needs to be an option, for instance.
Am using Folkert de Vries' *elm-paragraph*
library for this.

NOTES

1. At present, all the editor controls
are key commands.  Press the "Help" button,
in hte info panel, upper right, for a partial
list of these. Full list coming soon.

2. More parameters are now configurable.
For example, one can do this in Main:

editorState = Editor.init
   { defaultConfig | lines = 30
                   , showInfoPanel = False
   }

to set up the embedded editor with a 30-line
display and the info panel not shown.

3. I've tested the editor on a file of 1700
lines and 7700 words. It works fine.  For
a file of 17,000 lines and 770,000 words,
moving around the text is extremely fast,
whereas double-clicking to select a word
fails.  I don't know why as of this writing.

4. In view of (3), I've set the gutter width
to accommodate files of up to 9,999 lines.

ROADMAP

There is still a lot to do.
